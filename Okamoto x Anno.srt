00:00:01,727 --> 00:00:14,000
This video was recorded during a discussion between director Kihachi Okamoto and director Hideaki Anno for Animage magazine in 1996.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,774
Thanks to the cooperation of Kihachi Productions, director Anno, and others involved, we are able to broadcast this video.

3
00:00:25,873 --> 00:00:37,004
The video itself was not recorded for broadcast. We apologize in advance for the quality of the picture and sound, which may be difficult to catch.

4
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:49,899
Throughout this interview, we hope you can feel the joy and passion of making films.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The director known as the "Artisan of Entertainment", Kihachi Okamoto

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Evangelion series director, Hideaki Anno

7
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:11,372
A rare video interview between the two is now available.

8
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:18,981
Kihachi Okamoto and Hideaki Anno at the former Okamoto residence in Ikuta, 1996.

9
00:01:20,377 --> 00:01:24,000
The Screen

10
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:37,400
"Battle of Okinawa" is the movie I've seen the most times in my life. I've seen it over 100 times.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,929
Why did you like it so much?

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,500
I think it's a physiological thing.

15
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,641
When I went to shoot "Battle of Okinawa," the area south of Mabuni

16
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:58,776
was still scattered with human bones.

17
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:06,453
There were monuments for the loyal souls of each prefecture

18
00:02:06,453 --> 00:02:12,230
being built as if in competition with each other.

19
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:16,285
I thought it would be better to spend money

20
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:21,976
on collecting the bones and mourning than to build such things.

21
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:31,172
So I didn't like the southern part of that place itself because I had the feeling

22
00:02:31,592 --> 00:02:36,143
that there would be dead bodies buried there, even where I was walking.

23
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:45,431
I'm jealous of Anno's work, because in anime you can put as many people as you want in a shot.

19
00:02:47,600  -->  00:02:55,900
If it's a live action, every time you add an actor, it costs more money.
These days extras cost 6,800 yen per a day.

20
00:02:56,000  -->  00:03:01,250
But back then it was paid in US dollars.

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,188
We didn't have enough money, so 19 members of us went to Okinawa to film.

27
00:03:11,493 --> 00:03:14,733
But then 20-odd press people showed up there.

28
00:03:18,374 --> 00:03:24,108
I was really pissed off. "Why are there more reporters than us?"

29
00:03:24,500  -->  00:03:32,845
We couldn't afford enough actors, so I ended up in the film too. I played the role of the marine saying "I can't see the sea".

32
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,475
So you are in the film?

33
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,533
Yeah, because there weren't enough actors.

34
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:44,727
No wonder you said that you were jealous of anime filmmaking.

35
00:03:44,752 --> 00:03:48,401
But of course I'm sure there must be tough things as well.

36
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,800
Yes there are. I'm in turn jealous of live-action filmmaking.

37
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,220
If I worked in animation, I would be jealous of live-action, and perhaps likewise vice versa.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,673
So we both want what the other has.

40
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:07,063
You can't move the camera in animation.

41
00:04:07,320  -->  00:04:12,800
Recently, we started using CGI and it helps making animation much easier.
But even so, some cuts just stink of CGI.

43
00:04:14,027 --> 00:04:18,150
I can tell you're working pretty hard on it.

44
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:29,500
You make it look like people are moving by showing their shadows without moving the camera.

46
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:31,622
By shadows?
-Yeah.

47
00:04:33,020  -->  00:04:38,250
In case of animation, I mainly use a fixed camera.

37
00:04:38,300  -->  00:04:40,400
Or I can use a panning camera, too.

49
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:43,700
The tempo is good, too.

50
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,646
The tempo is directly influenced by Okamoto-san.

51
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:51,670
Thank you.

52
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:57,317
No one is doing it, but I believe that tempo is what's best for anime.

53
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,430
The charm of when you cut.

54
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,855
Not so much the content of the cut

55
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:06,136
I'm talking about the moment the shot changes. The satisfaction there.

56
00:05:06,136 --> 00:05:10,976
I feel there's a lot of that in your films.
And it's exactly that which is best for anime.

58
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,663
Again, the amount of information given by a fixed camera,
and the moment the shot changes.

60
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:19,546
The change in silhouette when a character immediately switches

61
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:21,525
from the right side of the frame to the left via the cut.

62
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:30,000
Especially with the dull standard aspect ratio,
I think that's about the only thing you can do.

64
00:05:30,452 --> 00:05:34,500
It's also great the way you use over-the-shoulder shot.

65
00:05:35,600  -->  00:05:42,000
Especially with Cinescope, it's great to be able to do that, isn't it? It's a shame we don't have Cinescope now.

67
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,200
Even with the Vista, I feel the frame is just halfway there, and it's not good enough.

68
00:05:45,250  -->  00:05:48,900
I hate standard aspect. But I don't like Vista either because it's not good enough.

69
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,595
Film by Cinescope is the best after all.

70
00:05:54,194 --> 00:05:59,000
With CinemaScope, it's interesting how to fill in the empty spaces.

71
00:05:59,619 --> 00:06:02,051
What do you mean by that?

72
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:18,337
For example, up to VistaVision size, both full shots and cowboy shots look good,

73
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,297
But when it comes to the CinemaScope size, whether you take a full shot or a cowboy shot,

74
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:28,950
you need to add something on both sides to make the shot look good.

75
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:36,563
But that makes it more interesting.

76
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,791
Also, with CinemaScope, the audience moves their heads

77
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:43,976
from right to left in the theater.

78
00:06:44,827 --> 00:06:47,429
I don't think you can do that with TV.

79
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:53,600
That's why I think there's just no point if it's not CinemaScope.

80
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:59,000
The Long Shot

81
00:07:00,443 --> 00:07:04,693
I was an assistant director for a good 15 years.

82
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:12,900
Generally, if directors don't have the obligation to teach the juniors, they also don't have the right to.

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You gradually learn from small talks,
when you were having a chat, or in a taxi on the way to work.

85
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:34,400
I learned that when you take a zooming picture, the lens should zoom in as close as possible.

86
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,847
And then when you take a long shot, the camera should be pulled away from the subject as far as possible.

89
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:46,640
It's better to have some kind of trigger for the next cut to get a rhythm.

90
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:53,900
Even just tapping the ash off your cigarette, you can shoot it as a long shot.

91
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,186
I heard that's better than just going to the next cut.

92
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,899
In fact, it's all about how far the camera angle can be pulled away from the subject.

93
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,900
Right.

94
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,400
But that was pretty pulled back. For us, we'd call that a long shot.

95
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,101
It's an extreme long shot, isn't it?

96
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,852
So the difference between the movie theater,

97
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:29,976
video specialty, and TV specialty is the long shot.

99
00:08:30,530  -->  00:08:42,000
For example, when you want to show emotions with a long shot instead of a close-up shot, the camera angle should be pulled pretty far away from the subject.

76
00:08:43,000  -->  00:08:49,000
I think it's a matter of how far the camera can go away from the subject. It's easy to do in anime because you can express it with drawings.

103
00:08:50,623 --> 00:08:54,681
But in that case, you can't make any mistakes with the drawing. If you're not a good enough illustrator, it's out of the question.

105
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,567
It depends on the painter, just as a good play depends on the actor.

106
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:05,800
It's the same in that respect.

107
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,632
Editing

108
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:16,150
Is the tempo of that editing a physiological thing?

109
00:09:16,175 --> 00:09:20,100
Do you cut by intuition, or have you already decided where to cut by the time you shoot?

111
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:22,403
Well, it's already been decided before shooting.

112
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:38,000
The minimum is 2 frames, but at least I need 8 frames for a single blink of an actor.
So I feel 8 frames is important.

115
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:44,924
I've heard that it's 8 or 7 frames. And that to leave something in the viewers' minds without letting them confirm anything, it'd be 6 frames.

116
00:09:45,000  -->  00:09:49,000
And that to make sure the viewers understand something, you need at least 9 frames.

118
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:56,976
I like using a multiple of 4. Like 8.

120
00:09:57,662 --> 00:10:04,761
So if someone with slightly big eyes looks at it without blinking, I need 12 frames.

121
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:11,620
I like using 4 and 7. Even 2 frames are enough to leave an impression if it's a drawing.

123
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:18,394
Right, 2 frames has a subliminal effect?

124
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,741
That's a myth though, I think.

125
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:26,700
In the case of animation, the amount of information is limited because it's a drawing.

126
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:31,040
Therefore if the drawing is familiar to the viewer, even 2 frames are enough to leave an impression.

127
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:43,061
7 frames would be more than enough. If it's a moving image, 7 frames.
If it's a still image though, even 2 or 3 frames can be too much.

129
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:47,299
Of course, 1 frame is not enough to understand.
but 2 frames are definitely enough.

131
00:10:48,701 --> 00:11:00,000
That's why I need 8 frames in a cut someone is running, 8 steps.

132
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,200
For walking, I feel 4 steps is enough.

133
00:11:05,780  -->  00:11:15,600
So if I decide the number of steps is 4, changing the count to an odd number gives the impression that the character is in a bit of a hurry.

134
00:11:17,358 --> 00:11:21,560
When it comes to battle scenes, I use 7 frames.

137
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:26,000
Right, I think it's better to use odd numbers in that situation.

138
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:29,000
I use 7 frames with the insert.

139
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:39,212
I actually shoot around 12 frames, and then in the cutting drop 3 frames or so. Maybe 6 or 5.

141
00:11:39,228 --> 00:11:46,000
In the case of animation, I decide where to cut at the drawing stage.

142
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,909
except for AC (action cuts).

143
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Also it depends on the tempo or the rhythm of the line.

144
00:11:57,495 --> 00:12:04,591
It takes me about 12 hours to cut 20 minutes.

145
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:10,587
The longest one was 24 hours; over two days.

146
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:21,608
In my case, I usually have only 4 days to edit.

147
00:12:23,044 --> 00:12:29,166
I did the editing of "EAST MEETS WEST" last year, and I had the same four days.

148
00:12:29,170  -->  00:12:33,000
It really wasn't my tempo overall.

150
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:44,473
I found out afterward that I had a brain infarct.
So I had been acting a bit strange since last February.

112
00:12:46,080  -->  00:12:54,300
If I had known I was sick, I would have spent another day or two editing and going through a lot of polishing.

113
00:12:54,400  -->  00:13:00,000
If I could have done that once or twice.
I think the film would have had the tempo it has now.

113
00:13:02,050  -->  00:13:06,400
But I was really bothered about it, so this spring I re-edited the film.

158
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:10,000
I didn't get my own tempo, so it bothered me so much.

159
00:13:10,432 --> 00:13:15,703
I have a bit of a short temper.

160
00:13:17,000  -->  00:13:27,800
For example, when I shoot a long scene, say 3-4 minutes, I might cut the opening and closing parts depending on if I'm annoyed.

162
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,920
I always cut off the last part of the cut, too.

163
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:38,144
It feels great when the scene changes right when the line ends.

164
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:44,472
Okamoto's films taught me that.

165
00:13:46,000  -->  00:13:49,300
My films are just imitations,
so I can't help but feel embarrassed when you watch them.

166
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,990
No, I think you're right.

167
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:58,600
It takes so long to get there by yourself.

169
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,528
Reaction Shots

170
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,434
Fundamentally, the audience won't enjoy it if you don't enjoy it yourself.

171
00:14:12,506 --> 00:14:14,394
Absolutely.

172
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,812
So you have to do what makes you feel good.

173
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:27,632
When you need a reaction shot, you show the side the viewers want to see.

174
00:14:28,203 --> 00:14:31,933
If a character is attacking another in one cut,

175
00:14:31,940  -->  00:14:38,200
the viewers want to see what kind of reaction the character on the defense has.
That's why I put in a reaction shot.

177
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:43,286
There's always a reaction shot in your films, isn't it?

178
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,500
That's why in scenes of 40-50 cuts, I make the attack and the defense reactions 50/50.

180
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:59,300
Young people say that's difficult. But as long as you remember to do it that way, I think it's the easiest.

182
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:03,776
"Blue Christmas" is also good.
There's always reaction shots in that one too.

184
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,200
I liked how there were never lines spoken off-camera.

185
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:15,576
Instead of a long take by a fixed camera,  it's keeps doing shot/reverse shot.
That's what's cool about "Blue Christmas."

187
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,276
No matter how small the reaction, it is shown.

188
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:27,436
For example even when Nakadai says "Oh" in reaction, it's shown.
That level of detail and thoroughness is great.

190
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,194
Invariably, if anything happens, a "yes" reaction is inserted.

191
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:39,434
I love cutting when "yes" is said.

192
00:15:40,434 --> 00:15:44,768
I also when storyboarding, always end up inserting those cuts.

193
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,986
The staff say that's too much though.

194
00:15:48,082 --> 00:15:57,566
But when I watched your work I had this feeling of closeness.

195
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:58,932
Thank you

196
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:00,456
That feeling was there, so...

197
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:08,984
If someone asked me who my favorite director was, I would say Kihachi Okamoto immediately.

199
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:10,723
It is a great honor.

200
00:16:13,945 --> 00:16:18,945
But sometimes when I watch a film that has no reaction shots,

201
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:26,970
When the story goes on and on, I start to want to see the other party's reaction.
I wonder what kind of face they're making, and my head starts to hurt.

205
00:16:27,250  -->  00:16:31,370
Recently, the style is to let the audience think about that.

207
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:35,633
Wondering if we've been giving them too much of that sense of closeness.

208
00:16:36,408 --> 00:16:39,501
I've been thinking about how to intentionally not show the reactions.

209
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,765
Well you have no other choice if you're doing long takes.

210
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,000
Nevertheless, I'm getting a little tired of that, and I'm wondering if there's something new.

212
00:16:49,848 --> 00:16:53,765
Eyeline

213
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:03,492
Lately, maybe I'm doing it on purpose, but I make an actor look the other way.

215
00:17:04,000  -->  00:17:10,000
I know the direction of eyes should go this way, but I change the direction to that way.

217
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,096
In my opinion, the direction of eyes is very important.

218
00:17:13,300  -->  00:17:20,400
For instance, I put in storyboards "eyeline this way."
I'm so influenced by you that I tend to make the character look into the camera.

220
00:17:20,450  -->  00:17:29,000
Well, the direction of eyeline should be as near as possible.
Nevertheless, A still needs to look at B while speaking.

221
00:17:29,100  -->  00:17:34,800
And B needs to look back at A in reaction.

224
00:17:34,900  -->  00:17:39,800
In my work there's so many shots where the characters look into the camera,
that the artists are getting starting to hate me though.

226
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:43,297
Because it's hard to draw the face straight on. It's not easy.

227
00:17:43,884 --> 00:17:48,024
It's also hard to act when the character looks into the camera.

228
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:52,330
But the eyelines that are close look more powerful, right?

229
00:17:52,331 --> 00:17:54,758
Right. I like that they have energy.

231
00:17:54,758 --> 00:18:00,113
The ones that shoot from the side,
the ones shot with a multi-cam setup...

233
00:18:00,114  -->  00:18:09,000
There's a lot of these on TV, where one shot is done properly, and the other is done sloppily.

235
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:11,760
I'm not a big fan of cutting between profile shots and straight-on shots.

236
00:18:11,770  -->  00:18:15,800
I prefer cutting between two straight-on shots, where both are looking at the camera.

237
00:18:16,200  -->  00:18:23,300
Where I'm able to beautifully show the character's eyes' positions in the frame.

239
00:18:24,100  -->  00:18:28,300
Drawings are at the end of the day two-dimensional, so the information is limited.

241
00:18:28,303 --> 00:18:34,100
When a cut occurs, I feel that the viewers look for the character's eyes.

242
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:39,203
That's why I think acting by eyes is important, but unfortunately people don't pay enough attention to it.

244
00:18:39,680  -->  00:18:45,280
It would be fine if they were doing it on purpose, but it doesn't look like that.

246
00:18:45,900  -->  00:18:49,000
It's like they're not even aware of it.
Or they just don't care.

247
00:18:50,000  -->  00:18:52,450
When I watch stuff like that it annoys me a bit.

248
00:18:52,580  -->  00:18:59,100
Moreover, anime characters have big eyes.

249
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:02,150
Yes indeed.

250
00:19:02,545 --> 00:19:07,720
There are practical reasons for that.

251
00:19:08,478 --> 00:19:16,080
The character needs to be in symbolic form.
Otherwise, it ends up being a drawing that not all artists can draw.

253
00:19:16,577 --> 00:19:18,561
But the good thing is that a character can act with eyes.

254
00:19:19,662 --> 00:19:21,975
By changing the position of the pupil, etc.

255
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yes, but a drawing is just a drawing.
So when an animated character does serious acting,

257
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,333
it becomes cheap after a certain point. It loses believability.

259
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:42,000
The Director's Job

260
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:48,422
There are still some young directors who have aspirations.

261
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,400
Still now.

262
00:19:51,675 --> 00:19:55,875
Yes, It's a few but I think we should count on them.

263
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,469
More than live-action, there's still some left in animation.

264
00:19:59,470  -->  00:20:04,700
As for live-action, there was a recent live-action film called "Gamera",

267
00:20:05,000  -->  00:20:07,219
Right. From Daiei Film.

267
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:17,353
I have a friend named Shinji Higuchi who does special effects,

268
00:20:17,354  -->  00:20:20,900
Even though his staff don't get paid a lot, they're driven by the passion for the craft.

269
00:20:21,300  -->  00:20:30,600
There are still some young people with ambition (willing to work hard for low pay) in live-action, but the medium's momentum is fading.

272
00:20:31,100  -->  00:20:45,000
The number of films peaked in 1958, the year I became a director. I was shooting about three films in a year at that time.

275
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:55,600
If we shoot one movie every four years like we've been doing lately, I accumulate things I want to say, so the length of the film gets longer.

278
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,694
We think that films are entertainment,

279
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:09,522
but we still make films with the motive of "Let me say something here, even if it's just one thing."

280
00:21:11,150  -->  00:21:24,765
For example, "Rainbow Kids".
The ¥10 billion scam itself is interesting too, but

282
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:42,460
At the end of the film, the kidnapped old lady mutters to herself, "What has my country done for me?"

284
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:48,009
That's it. I basically shot that whole film, all to say that one thing.

286
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,609
A director has two things. Something you want to say and something you want to do. I don't think I've done it completely,

289
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:03,576
But to a certain extent I've tried with the film "The Elegant Life of Mr. Everyman."

291
00:22:04,400  -->  00:22:11,000
It's not a matter of whether it's good or bad, but it's my favorite.

293
00:22:11,700  -->  00:22:22,500
But it's also the film the studio hated the most.
They got extremely angry, telling me, "We'll never let you write a script again."

296
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:29,772
All the films planned up until that point got shelved.

297
00:22:29,797 --> 00:22:33,414
In reaction, I wrote "Nikudan."

298
00:22:34,093 --> 00:22:40,293
There was no green light on the project, but I still wanted to write it.

299
00:22:41,120  -->  00:22:46,564
The battle between the director and the studio is in many ways just as hard as the filmmaking, eh?

301
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,252
Yeah.

302
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,000
I think that's happening everywhere, unless you pay for it all yourself.

304
00:22:57,000  -->  00:23:00,700
But it's still pretty relaxed here, compared to the US for instance.

305
00:23:02,203 --> 00:23:04,539
That's because directors have the right of final cut here.

306
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,640
That right belongs to the producers in the US.

307
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,264
Eventually, they might order you to cut something.

308
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,150
Right, the person who's paying for everything...

309
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,000
That person is the strongest.

310
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:28,635
For us, as long as we pay some money, we don't fight over right of editing.

311
00:23:28,636 --> 00:23:31,486
Editing is the only thing that is non-negotiable.

312
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:38,616
I once put negatives in my locker at home.

313
00:23:39,000  -->  00:23:46,600
After I finish storyboarding, I can get someone to do the rough cut.
But as we discussed previously, with the issue of the 2-frames or 8-frames problem,

316
00:23:46,601 --> 00:23:50,498
if I don't do the final cut myself, my rhythm won't show up in the film.

318
00:23:50,687 --> 00:23:54,888
In the case of animation, sometimes I have to work on the storyline without drawings.

320
00:23:54,913 --> 00:23:59,165
That's my duty, but it's tough indeed.

321
00:24:00,600  -->  00:24:03,200
But editing is so interesting.

322
00:24:04,000  -->  00:24:10,000
The trial and error at the end of the editing process is challenging and fun to do.

324
00:24:10,001  -->  00:24:13,500
Again, depending on whether I cut out 2 frames or not, it changes everything.

326
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,836
Kihachi Okamoto & Hideaki Anno
